Group: Group Q
Project: A Mobile Number Base Converter Application built with Flutter.
This section outlines the process our group followed to develop the Base Converter application, from planning and role assignment to the tools and methodologies we used.
1.Project Overview and Objectives
Our main goal was to create a simple and user-friendly mobile app for converting numbers between : Binary (Base 2), Octal (Base 8), Decimal (Base 10), and Hexadecimal (Base 16
2. Team Roles and Responsibilities
To ensure our project was organized and everyone knew their tasks, we assigned the following roles:
    Stephen Malii – Project Lead & Documentation.
        Coordinated the project schedule and kept the team on track.
        Managed communication between team members.
        Wrote and compiled the final project documentation (this document).
    Ambrose Ngeke – Lead Logic Developer
        Designed and wrote the core conversion logic in the ConversionService class.
        Developed the mathematical algorithms for converting between bases.
        Ensured the app could handle very large numbers correctly using BigInt.
    Dennis Mulwa – UI/UX Frontend Developer
        Designed the visual layout and user interface of the application.
        Built the UI using Flutter widgets like text fields, dropdowns, and buttons.
        Focused on making the app look good and easy to use.
    Margaret Gichunga – State & Integration Engineer
        Connected the user interface (the frontend) to the conversion logic (the backend).
        Managed the app's state, including handling user input and displaying the result.
        Implemented the error-handling logic to manage invalid user inputs.

    Karume Serah – Quality Assurance & Tester
        Thoroughly tested the application to find and report bugs.
        Checked for issues with input validation, UI layout, and conversion accuracy.
        Confirmed that the final application worked as expected
3. Development Methodology
We used a simple Agile approach for this project. Our workflow was:
    Planning: We began by listing the essential features the app needed.
    Design: We drew a basic sketch of the app's screen to guide our UI development.
    Development: We split the work into two parts: first, building the core conversion logic, and second, building the user interface and connecting everything.
    Testing: We regularly tested our work to catch bugs early.
    Finalization: We did one last round of testing and prepared this documentation.
