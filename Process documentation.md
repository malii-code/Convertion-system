Project: A Mobile Number Base Converter Application built with Flutter.
This section details the journey our team took to develop the Base Converter application, covering everything from planning and assigning roles to the tools and methods we employed.

1. Project Overview and Objectives 
Our primary aim was to create a straightforward and user-friendly mobile app that allows users to convert numbers between Binary (Base 2), Octal (Base 8), Decimal (Base 10), and Hexadecimal (Base 16).

2. Team Roles and Responsibilities
To keep our project organized and ensure everyone was clear on their tasks, we assigned the following roles:  
   Stephen Malii – Project Lead & Documentation

     - Managed communication among team members.  
     - Compiled and wrote the final project documentation (this document).  
   Ambrose Ngeke – Lead Logic Developer
     - Designed and implemented the core conversion logic in the ConversionService class.  
     - Developed the mathematical algorithms for converting between different bases.  
     - Ensured the app could accurately handle very large numbers using BigInt.  
   Dennis Mulwa – UI/UX Frontend Developer 
     - Crafted the visual layout and user interface of the application.  
     - Built the UI using Flutter widgets like text fields, dropdowns, and buttons.  
     - Focused on making the app visually appealing and user-friendly.  
   Margaret Gichunga – State & Integration Engineer
     - Linked the user interface (frontend) to the conversion logic (backend).  
     - Managed the app's state, including user input handling and result display.  
     - Implemented error-handling logic to manage invalid user inputs.  
   Karume Serah – Quality Assurance & Tester
     - Conducted thorough testing of the application to identify and report bugs.
